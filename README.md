Exploring core web development with Spring Boot and JSP. This project demonstrates a basic HTML form for inputting two numbers, processes them on the backend, and renders the sum on a results page. Clean design, clear functionality.



How to run the application (e.g., "Clone the repository, run mvn spring-boot:run")
Technologies Used (e.g., Java, Spring Boot, JSP, HTML, CSS)
Features (e.g., Accepts two numbers, calculates sum, displays result)
Screenshots (Highly recommended!)
Future Enhancements (If you plan any, like validation, more operations, etc.)
